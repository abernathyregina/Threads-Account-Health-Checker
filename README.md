##Introduction
The Threads Account Health Checker automates the tedious process of monitoring and validating multiple Threads accounts. It detects bans, login errors, shadow restrictions, and API throttling issues—ensuring every account in your automation farm remains operational and compliant.

### Automating Threads Account Diagnostics
- Continuously scans Threads account performance metrics like login validity, posting capability, and device binding.
- Alerts users in real-time when any account becomes inactive or restricted.
- Tracks engagement and activity levels to identify potentially throttled or soft-banned accounts.
- Automatically retries or rebinds failing sessions using pre-configured recovery logic.
- Generates a full health report dashboard for each Threads profile.

## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** — The user initiates health checks via the Appilot dashboard by selecting Threads profiles or device groups.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot uses UI Automator and Appium to simulate login attempts, post verifications, and status polling without human input.  
3. **Output or Action** — The system reports health metrics, flags risky accounts, and updates dashboards or sends alerts.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Configurable error handling, retry attempts, and adaptive proxy rotation ensure zero downtime across checks.

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Python, Java, Kotlin  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Accessibility API, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Firebase Test Lab  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Proxy management layer, Cloud emulators, Real device farm scaling.

## Use Cases
- **Agency managers** use it to verify hundreds of Threads accounts daily and ensure all stay active.  
- **Marketers** use it to maintain clean, verified accounts for campaigns without risking suspension.  
- **Automation developers** use it to integrate account health metrics into larger Threads automation workflows.  
- **Community managers** use it to detect shadowbans or posting restrictions before scheduling content.  

## FAQs
**Q1: Can I connect multiple devices to run checks in parallel?**  
Yes, Appilot supports multi-device execution, allowing simultaneous health checks across all connected Android devices.  

**Q2: How do I integrate my proxy list?**  
You can load proxy details via the `config/settings.yaml` or connect an API endpoint for dynamic proxy assignment.  

**Q3: Does it detect soft bans or throttling?**  
Absolutely — the bot identifies posting restrictions and unusual delays in engagement metrics to signal potential throttling.  

**Q4: Can it auto-recover banned or logged-out accounts?**  
Yes, with configured recovery scripts, it can trigger session refresh or rebind actions automatically.  

**Q5: Is reporting customizable?**  
All reports can be exported as JSON, CSV, or viewed directly on the Appilot dashboard.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks
- **Execution Speed:** Checks up to 150 accounts per minute on a single node.  
- **Success Rate:** 95% success in login and validation tests.  
- **Scalability:** Supports scaling to 300–1000 concurrent accounts via multi-device orchestration.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lightweight and asynchronous design ensures low CPU and memory usage.  
- **Error Handling:** Advanced retry logic, event-based logging, and auto-recovery for interrupted sessions.
